      "description": "The massive wall is broken here by a series of five gates. Descending from these open archways down to the level of the plain are five ramps made of the same golden translucent material as the walls. Beyond the gates, the streets and alleys of the city are only partially visible, shrouded by a pale green mist that seems to seep out of the walls and cling to the ground.",

There seems to be no entrance at ground level, but each wall has a large hole on the right-hand side about halfway up the tower.",

Hundreds of books are piled neatly on the tables, and many scrolls are held open with paperweights. A humanoid skeleton sits in one of the chairs here, a book still open on the table at its side. A high-pitched chattering comes from the rafters overhead.",

The frescos near the bottom seem to show a parade of citizens and a few tall towers and buildings. The higher paintings are difficult to see from the bottom.
